<!-- My name is `Markus Fox`, and I'm a `researcher/engineer` at the *University of Klagenfurt* working in `computer vision` and `machine learning`. I enjoy programming and learning new technologies. In general, I'm a very down-to-earth and calm person. In my spare time, I like going for long walks, listening to podcasts, watching sports, and I'm also a passionate sim-racer, competing in online championships and one-off events. 

I've recently finished my `Dipl.-Ing. (MSc)` in `computer science` at the *University of Klagenfurt*. Now, I want to apply my problem-solving and technical skills to the benefit of people and organizations. I'm looking for an employer/team that tries to solve exciting and challenging problems, while respecting the work-life balance of their employees. -->

My name is `Markus Fox`. Iâ€™m a `computer scientist`, developing software, analyzing data, and finding use-cases for applying AI algorithms.

Technology and sports have always been at the center of my attention. In the past, I have been active in various activities and roles. Iâ€˜m a former pool billiard and semi-professional poker player. I have also competed in multiple eSports tournaments (HoN, DotA). Nowadays, Iâ€™m a `passionate sim-racer`, competing in online championships and one-off events. Last but not least, I have acquired a masterâ€™s degree in computer science, where I specialized in `software development` and `machine learning`.

<!-- I have always enjoyed activities that require complete control of consciousness and an immense amount of grit to master. For this reason, I have explored some unlikely paths.

In my youth I competed in various pool billard championships, winning three medals (2x silver, 1x bronze) in the Carinthian youth state championships and qualifying for the Austrian national championships (age class <= 17 years). During this time, I learned what it means to participate in a competitive environment while still enjoying the process. When I was 18 years old, I quickly turned a second hobby into my part-time job, playing poker for several years as a semi-professional player (earning an average of ~11â‚¬/hour in the last years of playing).

As I knew I wouldn't be playing poker forever, I completed my Master's degree in computer science at the University of Klagenfurt, specializing in machine learning and data engineering. Computers are the tools I have always used to get things done. I remember creating my first website at the age of 12 (the code was terrible ðŸ˜…). As I consider myself an intellectual person, I am drawn to research in artificial intelligence.

Although it might sound like I am all over the place, I am actually a very down to earth and relaxed person. I like going for long walks, planning ahead, and watching some television. -->
