My name is `Markus Fox`, and I'm a `researcher/engineer` at the *University of Klagenfurt* working in `computer vision` and `machine learning`. I enjoy programming and learning new technologies. In general, I'm a very down-to-earth and calm person. In my spare time, I like going for long walks, listening to podcasts, watching sports, and I'm also a passionate sim-racer, competing in online championships and one-off events. 

I've recently finished my `Dipl.-Ing. (MSc)` in `computer science` at the *University of Klagenfurt*. Now, I want to apply my problem-solving and technical skills to benefit other people and organizations. I'm looking for an employer/team that tries to solve exciting and challenging problems, while caring about the work-life balance of their employees.

If you're curious about what books I'm reading, check out my [blog post](https://markusfox.github.io/blog/read-books/).
